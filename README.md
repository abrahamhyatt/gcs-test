# Glasgow Coma Scale Self-Test

How fast can you calculate Glasgow Coma Scale scores? For EMS/nursing/medical students.

The [Glasgow Coma Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale) (GCS) is used by EMTs, paramedics, nurses and doctors to quantify level of consciousness in acute trauma and non-trauma patients. The scale tests eye, verbal and motor responses. The lowest score, for coma or death, is 3; the highest, for a fully responsive patient, is 15.

Because the GCS Self-Test is randomized, some test scenarios may be implausible.
